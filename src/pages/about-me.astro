      <p>‍</p>
      <p>My name is Mónika Szigeti I was born in Nyíregyháza. 27 years ago I moved to Budapest and found myself in the
        middle of the crowded urban lifestyle realizing that I didn’t like my profession at all so I started to look
        for something I&#x27;d feel passionate about. I tried many different areas, in vain. I didn’t feel happy, I
        missed the enthusiasm, the ’aha’ reaction, which made me feel that yes, this was my dream job! I was looking
        for the right profession until 2005, when first went to a massage that changed my life forever.</p>
      <p>It helped me to release my everyday problems and made me feel relaxed and disconnected. On that day I knew
        for certain I would be a masseuse! My goal is to help others, give the opportunity to break the stressed days
        and create unique atmosphere where everybody could concentrate for physical and spiritual replenishment.</p>
      <p>In 2005 I came up with the idea that besides my work I began to learn various types of massage. I have always
        striven for internal and external harmony so I started to learn the eastern and western massage types such as:
      </p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li>shiatsu basics</li>
        <li>hot stone massage</li>
        <li>Swedish massage</li>
        <li>refreshing foot massage</li>
        <li>healing massage</li>
        <li>maternity, baby massage</li>
        <li>kinesio tapeing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I have completed several Prana-nadi courses and have mastered the techniques of Kinesio tape. I’ve been
        training myself professionally, physically, mentally and spiritually.</p>
      <p>I got my work experience among VIP sections of the Széchenyi Spa, and in Hotel Gellért. I worked at Magnolia
        Day Spa. Currently I work as a private entrepreneur, mostly 4 and 5 stars hotels, wellness, office buildings,
        with families and individuals. In 2017 I provided massages for athletes with my colleagues at international
        beach volleyball at Siófok. We also gave service at VIP Plage massage in Siofok.</p>
      <p>Trust, accuracy, purity, external and internal harmony are the most important values for me.</p>
      <p>If you want a reliable masseuse in your office or home, please contact me via e-mail or phone. I’m working
        with colleagues sharing similar values.</p>
      <p>I look forward to seeing you!</p>
